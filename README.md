This is the Github repository for We R Consulting LLC.

## Our Mission
There are generally two types of missions that the data team fulfills: create Insights, and build Products.

Insights are about creating and sharing results, serving two purposes:
- Decision making: Across We R Consulting LLC., people need to quickly make impactful decisions. We create or empower the team to create the minimal results that make those decisions possible.
- Objective setting: At We R Consulting LLC, we believe the quantification of success can be a powerful driver to align teams. We need to know what objectives are trackable, design the corresponding measures, and define the level on the measure that corresponds to success.

At We R Consulting LLC., we currently have 3 areas of application of our missions:
- Growth: From sales ops & support to data analytics.
- Product: Product decision support, data-powered features.
- Operations: Care (i.e., Customer Support) analytics.
